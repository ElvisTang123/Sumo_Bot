# Sumo_Bot

# Project Introduction
Sumo Bot is a sport that two robots try to push each other out of the circle arena. In order to push other robot out and keep themselves in the arena, normally there are a few line detect sensors at the bottom of the robot to sense the edge of the arena and couples of distance sensors on the robot to measure their opponents' location.<br />
In this project, we are going to build a sumo bot from scratch. This includes the PCB design, car shell CAD design, and firmware development for motors, sensors and other electronic components.<br />
